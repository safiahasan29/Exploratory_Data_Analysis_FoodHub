📘 FoodHub Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This project focuses on performing an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the FoodHub dataset. The goal is to understand customer behavior, restaurant performance, cuisine preferences, order patterns, and overall operational efficiency for a food delivery platform.

The full notebook (HTML file) with all charts, code, and detailed analysis is included in this repository.
